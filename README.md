# Multimodal PDF Question Answering with CLIP and FAISS

 I made this project inspired by my graduation project which will be a whole 
management system for our college ,developing this idea we will be a making chat bot to help students with their books and any thing related to college.



This project is a  PDF Question Answering system  that allows users to upload PDF documents, ask natural-language questions, and get accurate answers  directly extracted from the PDF content  â€” with  visual highlights  showing exactly where the answer appears.

It uses  SentenceTransformerâ€™s CLIP model  for text embeddings and  FAISS  for efficient similarity search, enabling  semantic understanding  of questions and answers.

## ðŸš€ Features

-    Semantic Search  â€” Finds relevant text based on meaning, not just keywords.  
-    PDF Upload & Management  â€” Upload multiple PDFs and choose which one to query.  
-    Answer Extraction  â€” Retrieves the most relevant answer snippet from the document.  
-    Bounding Box Highlighting  â€” Highlights the answerâ€™s exact position in the PDF page.  
-    Efficient Retrieval  â€” Uses  FAISS  for fast vector search across large documents.  
-    Multimodal Embeddings  â€” Powered by  CLIP (ViT-B/32  for text-image understanding.  

 
##   Tech Stack

-  Python   
-  Google Colab 
-  FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search 
-  PyMuPDF (fitz  for text and coordinates extraction
-  Sentence Transformers (CLIP-ViT-B-32 
-  PIL (Pillow  for image rendering and highlighting
-  NumPy  for numerical operations

 

##   Project Workflow

1.  Upload PDFs  â€” The user uploads one or more PDF files into `/pdfs`.  
2.  Extract Text & Coordinates  â€” Each PDF pageâ€™s text blocks and bounding boxes are extracted.  
3.  Embed Sentences  â€” All text blocks are converted to dense embeddings using CLIP.  
4.  Build FAISS Index  â€” The embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector index for fast search.  
5.  Ask Question  â€” User types a natural-language question.  
6.  Retrieve Answers  â€” FAISS finds the most similar text block to the query.  
7.  Display Results  â€” The answer text and its location are shown, with a  red box highlight  on the original PDF page.


 
 

##   How to Use

1.  Run all cells  in the notebook or script.
2.  Upload your PDF files  when prompted.
3. Select a PDF from the list.
4. Enter your  question .
5. View the  highlighted answer  directly in the notebook output.

Example interaction:
```
âœ… PDFs uploaded to /pdfs
Available PDFs:
1. data_science_book.pdf
2. ai_research_paper.pdf

Ask your question: What is reinforcement learning?

Answer (Page 12):
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where agents learn by receiving rewards or penalties for their actions.
```

 

   # Future Enhancements

- Add a  Streamlit UI  with a chat-style interface.  
- Integrate  image-based search  using CLIPâ€™s image encoder.  
- Support  multi-page answers  and summaries.  
- Enable  deployment on Hugging Face Spaces  or  Colab + pyngrok.
